# Use case:
For a fraud detection project, where we have transaction data for phone numbers but lack labels (i.e., we don't know which transactions are fraudulent), a deep learning-based, self-supervised approach is the best choice. Since we don't have labeled data, we will need to design a model that can learn useful patterns and representations from the data itself.

# Self-supervised-model:

In this repo we create a robust fraud detection system that leverages self-supervised learning using Autoencoders to detect fraudulent transactions without the need for labeled data. Additionally, as fraud patterns evolve, this model will be able to adapt and generalize better.

# Objective:

For such a fraud detection project, where we have transaction data for phone numbers but lack labels (i.e., we don't know which transactions are fraudulent), a deep learning-based, self-supervised approach is a great idea. Since we don't have labeled data, we will need to design a model that can learn useful patterns and representations from the data itself. Here is an innovative methods we are exploring in this repo:

# Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders:

Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, particularly for anomaly detection. The basic idea is to train the model to reconstruct the input (phone number transactions in our case), so that the model learns a compact representation of normal transaction patterns.
Training Process: Use the autoencoder to learn the "normal" patterns of transaction behavior for phone numbers. During training, the autoencoder learns to compress the data into a latent space and then reconstruct it back to the original format.
Fraud Detection: When a new transaction happens, if the reconstruction error is significantly higher than usual, we can flag that transaction as potentially fraudulent, assuming that the normal behavior does not match well with the fraud pattern.

# Variations: 

We could also experiment with different types of autoencoders:
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): They allow for probabilistic generation of new data and might capture more nuanced distributions.
Sparse Autoencoders: Introduce sparsity constraints to enforce more compact representations.
Denoising Autoencoders: Train the model by intentionally adding noise to the input data and having it reconstruct the clean data.
